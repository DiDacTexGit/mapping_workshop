        <p>
            This was a joint effort between the
            <a href="http://codefordayton.org">Code for Dayton</a>,
            <a href="http://gdidayton.com">Girl Develop It Dayton</a>,
            and <a href="http://daytondv.org">Dayton Data Visualization</a> groups.
            It was originally given on Sept. 10, 2016 by Michael Bowman.

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>
            This workshop beginner friendly, but there are some tools and technologies you should have a passing familiarity with before the workshop.
        </p>

        <p>
            You will be making maps for use on web pages, so you should be familiar
            with the basics of writing a web page with HTML and CSS.</p>
        <ul>
             <li>Though I was able to follow with out this knowledge</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            A good introduction to each of these is Mozilla's Web Guides for
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction">HTML</a> and
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started">CSS</a>.
        </p>

        <p> All of the maps will be made using JavaScript. Mozilla also has a great introductory guide for
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics">JavaScript</a>, but we'll go over everything you'll need to make a map in class.
        </p>
        <p>
          And finally having you will need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>* Text editor like <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text</a> or <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> (NOTE these are not approved on RDTE however Notepad approved) for writing code.</li>
            <li>* Python</li>
            <li>* Chrome</li>
        </ul>
