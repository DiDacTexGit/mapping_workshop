        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>
            We're aiming to keep this workshop beginner friendly, but there are some tools and technologies you should have a passing familiarity with before the workshop.
        </p>

        <p>
            We'll be making maps for use on web pages, so you should be familiar with the basics of writing a web page with HTML and CSS.

            A good introduction to each of these is Mozilla's Web Guides for
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction">HTML</a> and
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started">CSS</a>.
        </p>

        <p> All of the maps will be made using JavaScript. Mozilla also has a great introductory guide for
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics">JavaScript</a>, but we'll go over everything you'll need to make a map in class.
        </p>
        <p>
          And finally having a text editor like like <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text</a> or <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> for writing code.
