                This is a joint effort between the
                <a href="http://codefordayton.org">Code for Dayton</a>,
                <a href="http://gdidayton.com">Girl Develop It Dayton</a>,

            <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
            <p>
                We're aiming to keep this workshop beginner friendly, but there
                are some tools and technologies you should have a passing
                familiarity with before the workshop. We'll be making maps for
                use on web pages, so you should be familiar with the basics of
                writing a web page with HTML and CSS. A good introduction to
                each of these is Mozilla's Web Guides for
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction">HTML</a>
                and
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started">CSS</a>.
                All of the maps will be made using JavaScript. Mozilla also has
                a great introductory guide for
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics">JavaScript</a>,
                but we'll go over everything you'll need to make a
                map in class.
