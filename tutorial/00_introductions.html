        <h1>Introductions</h1>

        <p>
            This workshop was <strong>originally</strong> organized and taught by members of the three Dayton area meetups listed below. If you have fun during this workshop and want to learn more, please consider joining. The tech community in Dayton is extrordinarily vibrant and these meetups
            are a great chance to network and learn along with some of the best programmers in the area.

        <h2>Code for Dayton</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="http://codefordayton.org" target="_blank"><img src="../images/cfd.png" class="float-left" width="185" title="Code for Dayton" /></a> We are a <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/">Code for America Brigade</a>, which means we're volunteers that contribute our talents toward
            improving the way our local governments and community organizations use the web to interact with their constituents.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal is two fold - we increase citizen engagement with municipal government, and show government and community organizations what is possible with open source and open data.
        </p>

        <h2>Girl Develop It Dayton</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="http://gdidayton.com" target="_blank"><img src="../images/gdi-dayton-logo.png" class="float-left" width="185" title="Girl Develop It" /></a> GDI Dayton is a local chapter of a national non-profit <a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com">Girl Develop It</a>, that began as a call
            to action for women, by women who were tired of the low representation of women in tech, and wanted to make a difference. Our vision is to create a network of empowered women who feel confident in their abilities to code and build beautiful
            web and mobile applications. By teaching women around the world from diverse backgrounds to learn software development, we can help women improve their careers and confidence in their everyday lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are committed to making sure women of all races, education levels, income and upbringing can build confidence in their skill set to develop web and mobile applications. We service that mission by offering events and affordable classes and we pride
            ourselves on being inclusive of all gender identities and ethnicities.

        <h2>Dayton Data Visualization</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="http://daytondv.org" target="_blank"> <img src="../images/daytondv-color.svg" class="float-left" width="185" title="Dayton Data Visualization" /> </a>
            The Dayton Data Visualization meetup was started by Michael Bowman and Chris Dickman of <a href="http://www.appliedis.com">Applied Information Sciences</a>
            in November of 2015 as a way to gather Dayton area programmers to network and share tips and tricks
            relating to data visualization and data science. Since then, we've grown to 300 members and have hosted a number of great speakers
            on a wide variety of topics.
        </p>
        We meet quarterly to have discussions around anything realted to data visualization, from libraries and frameworks to design and storytelling.
        Topics include (but not limited to): Infographic Design and Development, Web Mapping, D3.js, R, Tableau,
        Matlab, Processing, Hadoop, Data Mining, etc... Anything to do with the design/development of awesome visualizations!
